  To access the test you have to enter the directory created from git clone, then the test can be ran through the bash script.

Keys Pressed: `<r2> <:wq>`  
  The image shows the after edit, but after the previous command the cursor was already perfectly in place over the error. The error was then fixed by replacing it with "2" then saving and exiting.

Keys Pressed: `<up> <up> <enter>`  
  To rerun the test script, pressing up arrow twice would go through the command history where I last used the command.
