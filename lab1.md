``` $ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu ```  
**Note:** Do not type $, it is the conventional form of commands
3. The output should look something like this  
```
ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```  
4. Type `yes` and press enter

## Part 4: Running Commands
Here are some specific useful commands to try:

* cd ~
  * test
* cd
  * cd stands for change directory
* ls -lat
  * ls lists out content of directory
* ls -a
  * 
* ls <directory> where <directory> is /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/cs15lsp23abc, where the abc is one of the other group membersâ€™ username
  * 
* cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/
  * 
* cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt
